# SimpleECS
A simple Entity–Component–System (ECS) framework inspired by the article [A Simple Entity Component System (ECS) [C++]](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/) by [Austin Morlan](https://austinmorlan.com/).

The original implementation has been extended with additional functionality not covered in the article, and several classes were refactored to better fit an architecture I use across other projects.
